//*Predict Functions (Practice) - Bowen, Gregg

/*Predict 1: What will the console.log state when this function is called?

function myBirthYearFunc(){
    console.log("I was born in" + 1980);
}
myBirthYearFunc();

*/

//*MY SOLUTION: The console.log state when this function was called was blank. It isn't until it is called that the
//*function will work. However, when the function does run, the console.log will say "I was born in 1980".


/*Predict 2: If we needed to send a birth year to the function, we would tell the function "hey, we're gonna send you a variable called birthYearInput." We do that by adding the parameter name into the parentheses. See below for an example.

If this function is called with the argument 1980, what would the console.log state?

function myBirthYearFunc(birthYearInput){
    console.log("I was born in" + birthYearInput);
}
myBirthYearFunc(1980);
*/

//*MY SOLUTION** The console.log would say "I was born in 1980"

/* Predict 3: Let's try it again. If var num1 = 10 and var num2 = 20, what would the various console.logs state?

function add(num1, num2){
    console.log("Summing Numbers!");
    console.log("num1 is: " + num1);
    console.log("num2 is: " + num2);
    var sum = num1 + num2;
    console.log(sum);
}
add(10, 20);
*/

//*MY SOLUTION** The console.log would say: Summing Numbers!,num1 is 10,num2 is 20,30
